=== Easy FancyBox ===

== Translation ==

1. Install PoEdit on your computer.

2. Open the template translation database easy-fancybox-xx_XX.po in this plugins /languages/ directory with PoEdit.

3. Go to Edit > Preferences and on the tab Editor check the option to compile a .mo database on save automatically. Close with OK.

4. Go to Catalog > Settings and set your name, e-mail address, language and country. Close with OK.

5. Go to Catalog > Update from POT-file and select the main xml-sitemap-feed.pot file. Then accept any new and removed translation strings with OK.

6. Now go ahead and start translating all the texts listed in PoEdit.

7. When done, go to File > Save as... and replace the xx_XX in the file name with the appropriate language and country code for your translation. Leave the rest of the file name the same and Save.

8. Upload the automatically created xml-sitemap-feed-xx_XX.mo database file (where xx_XX should now be your language and country code) to the plugins /languages/ directory on your WordPress site.

9. After verifying the translations work on your site, send the .mo file to ravanhagen@gmail.com and don't forget to tell me how and with what link you would like to be mentioned in the credits!

Thanks for sharing your translation :)
