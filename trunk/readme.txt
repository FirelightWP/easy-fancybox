Search for "easy fancybox" and install with that slick **Plugins > Add New** back-end page.

 &hellip; OR &hellip;

Follow these steps:

 1. Download archive.

 2. Upload the zip file via the Plugins > Add New > Upload page &hellip; OR &hellip; unpack and upload with your favourite FTP client to the /plugins/ folder.

 3. Activate the plugin on the Plug-ins page.

= WordPress 3+ in Multi Site mode =

Same as above but do a **Network Activate** to activate FancyBox image overlays on each site on your network.

= Wordpress MU =

The plugin works best from the **/mu-plugins/** folder where it runs quietly in the background without bothering any blog owner with new options or the need for special knowledge about FancyBox. Just upload the complete package content to /mu-plugins/ and move the file fancybox.php from the new /mu-plugins/easy-fancybox/ to /mu-plugins/.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's FancyBox? =

Basically, it is a fancy way of presenting images on your website. If you have scaled-down images in your posts which are linked to the original large version, instead of opening them in a blanc page, FancyBox opens those in a smooth overlay. Visit [FancyBox](http://fancybox.net/) for more information and examples. 

= Why EASY FancyBox? =

Instead of bothering you with the HUGE amount of configuration options that FancyBox can handle, this plugin requires NO configuration. Easy, isn't it? ;)

If you *do* want configuration options to tweak and fiddle for days to come, check out some of the other FancyBox plugins available.

= Which version of FancyBox does this plugin use? =

The same version as this plugin has. I aim to keep close pace to FancyBox upgrades and always move to the latest and greates version. Please, let me know if I'm lagging behind and missed an upgrade!

= Where is the settings page? =

There is no settings page. It just *does what it does*. Check out the example under Screenshots and you see what that is...

= Is Easy FancyBox multi-site compatible? =

Yes.

= Can I Network Activate this plugin? =

Yes.

= Can I install it in mu-plugins? =

Yes. Upload the complete /easy-fancybox/ directory to /wp-content/mu-plugins/ and move the file fancybox.php one dir up.

== Screenshots ==

1. Example image with **Overlay** caption. This is the only way Easy FancyBox currently displays images. Future releases will include **Inside** and the old **Outside** as alternatives.
