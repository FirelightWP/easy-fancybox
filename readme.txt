== Installation ==

Install like any other plugin. Search for 'lightbox' or 'easy fancybox' from your WordPress admin plugin page. Or download the zip from this page, and upload the zip via your admin plugins page.

= Wordpress Multiste =

The plugin is compatible with multisite. You can enable the plugin network wide, or allow individual sites to activate it.

When activating the plugin per site, each site will have the Images media type activated and Easy FancyBox will immediately try opening image links in the light box.

When activated network wide with **Network Activate**, each sub-site will _not_ have any media type activated. The options will be there for individual site admins, ready to either activate or leave deactivated.

== Screenshots ==

1. Example image with **Overlay** caption. This is the default way Easy FancyBox displays images. Other options are **Inside** and the old **Outside**.

2. Example of a YouTube movie in overlay.
