Easily enable the FancyBox light box on just about all media links. Multi-Site compatible. Supports iframe, inline content and well known video hosts.

== Description ==

Easy FancyBox plugin for WordPress websites gives you a flexible and aesthetic light box solution for just about all media links on your website. Easy FancyBox uses an updated version of the traditional FancyBox jQuery extension and is WP 3+ Multi-Site compatible. After activation you can find a new section **FancyBox** on your **Settings > Media** admin page where you can manage the media light box options.

After activation, all links to **JPG, GIF and PNG images** are automatically opened in the [FancyBox](http://fancybox.net/) Mac/Gnome-style lightbox that floats over the web page.

**GDPR / EU Privacy**

This plugin does not collect any data and does not set any browser cookies. However, the PRO version offers an option to disable the automatic popup after the first visit, which needs a browser cookie. This cookie stores the visitors first website visit timestamp and path on the client side. It is not shared nor is any data stored server side or elsewhere.

== Installation ==

= Wordpress =

Quick installation: [Install now](https://coveredwebservices.com/wp-plugin-install/?plugin=easy-fancybox) !

 &hellip; OR &hellip;

Search for "easy fancybox" and install with that slick **Plugins > Add New** back-end page.

 &hellip; OR &hellip;

Follow these steps:

 1. Download archive.

 2. Upload the zip file via the Plugins > Add New > Upload page &hellip; OR &hellip; unpack and upload with your favorite FTP client to the /plugins/ folder.

 3. Activate the plugin on the Plug-ins page.

Done! By default, any images that are linked to directly (not to a WordPress page) from within your posts and pages, should now be opening in a FancyBox overlay :)

Not happy with the default settings? Check out the new options under **Settings > Media**.

= Wordpress MU / WordPress 3+ in Multi Site mode =

Install as above. You can activate the plugin per site, or network wide.

When activating the plugin per site, each site will have the Images media type activated and Easy FancyBox will immediately try opening image links in the light box.

When activated network wide with **Network Activate**, each sub-site will _not_ have any media type activated. The options will be there for individual site admins, ready to either activate or leave deactivated.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's FancyBox? =

Basically, it is a fancy way of presenting images, movies, portable documents and inline content on your website. For example, if you have scaled-down images in your posts which are linked to the original large version, instead of opening them on a blank page, FancyBox opens those in a smooth overlay. Visit [FancyBox](http://fancybox.net/) for more information and examples.


= Which version of FancyBox does this plugin use? =

This plugin uses an **updated version** of the original [FancyBox 1.3.4](http://fancybox.net), better adapted to the mobile era.


= I installed the plugin. What now? =

First, make sure that image  thumbnails in your posts and pages are linked to their full size counterpart directly. Open any post with thumbnail images in it for editing and select the first thumbnail. Click the **Edit Image** button that appears and choose **Link To: Media File**. From now on, clicking that thumbnail should open the full size version in FancyBox.

The same thing goes for WordPress Galleries. Choose **Link To: Media File** when inserting a gallery tag.


= Where is the settings page? =

There is no new settings page but there are many options you can change. You will find a new **FancyBox** section on **Settings > Media**. To see the default, check out the example under [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/screenshots/) ...


= Help! It does not work... =

Please follow the [trouble shooting steps](https://premium.status301.com/knowledge-base/easy-fancybox/troubleshooting/) to determine the cause. If that fails, ask for support on the [Easy FancyBox WordPress forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-fancybox) or go to the [development site](https://status301.net/wordpress-plugins/easy-fancybox/)


= I have another question... =

See the advanced [Easy FancyBox FAQ's](https://premium.status301.com/knowledge-base/easy-fancybox/faqs/).


== Screenshots ==

1. Example image with **Overlay** caption. This is the default way Easy FancyBox displays images. Other options are **Inside** and the old **Outside**.

2. Example of a YouTube movie in overlay.
